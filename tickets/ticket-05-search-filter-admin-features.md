## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Filtering
- [ ] Client-side filtering for < 1000 records
- [ ] Server-side filtering for larger datasets
- [ ] Debounced search input (300ms delay)
- [ ] Cached filter results
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large result sets

### Optimized Rendering
- [ ] Only re-render changed table rows
- [ ] Batch DOM updates
- [ ] Use document fragments for bulk operations
- [ ] Lazy load non-visible content

## Definition of Done
- ✅ Global search works across all visible columns
- ✅ Filter system provides real-time results
- ✅ Admin view toggle switches data context correctly
- ✅ Platform management interface fully functional
- ✅ Bulk operations work with proper confirmations
- ✅ Audit log displays filterable change history
- ✅ Export functionality generates clean files
- ✅ All admin features properly permission-gated
- ✅ Performance optimized for large datasets
- ✅ URL state preservation for filters
